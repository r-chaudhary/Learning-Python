Welcome! Are you completely new to programming? If not then we presume you will be looking for inf-
ormation about why and how to get started with Python. Fortunately an experienced programmer in an-
y programming language (whatever it may be) can pick up Python very quickly. It's also easy for be-
ginners to use and learn, so jump in!Before getting started, you may want to find out which IDEs a-
nd text editors are tailored to make Python editing easy, browse the list of introductory books, o-
r look at code samples that you might find helpful.The online documentation is your first port of -
call for definitive information. There is a fairly brief tutorial that gives you basic information-
 about the language and gets you started. You can follow this by looking at the library reference -
for a full description of Python's many libraries and the language reference for a complete (thoug-
h somewhat dry) explanation of Python's syntax. If you are looking for common Python recipes and p-
atterns, you can browse the ActiveState Python Cookbook. If you want to know whether a particular -
application, or a library with particular functionality, is available in Python there are a number-
 of possible sources of information. The Python web site provides a Python Package Index (also kno-
wn as the Cheese Shop, a reference to the Monty Python script of that name). There is also a searc-
h page for a number of sources of Python-related information. Failing that, just Google for a phra-
se including the word ''python'' and you may well get the result you need. If all else fails, ask -
on the python newsgroup and there's a good chance someone will put you on the right track.
